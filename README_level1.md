# Level 1 — Improvement & Analysis

Building on Level 0, we apply **image preprocessing for OCR** and **audio preprocessing for ASR** in order to evaluate their effect on recognition accuracy.

The goal of this level is to **compare different preprocessing techniques and analyze their real impact**, not necessarily to maximize performance.

## What's New in Level 1

| Task  | What we added                                  |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| OCR   | Image preprocessing with OpenCV                |
| ASR   | Audio preprocessing with librosa + noisereduce |
| Bonus | Text-to-Speech (TTS) using gTTS                |

# OCR Preprocessing (`ocr_level1.py`)

We tested 4 preprocessing methods and evaluated results using **Accuracy + Similarity metrics**.

| Step             | Effect                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| Grayscale        | Removes color noise      |
| Threshold (Otsu) | Converts image to binary |
| Resize ×2        | Enlarges text            |
| Denoise          | Removes image noise      |

# ASR Preprocessing (`asr_level1.py`)

We tested Whisper transcription with different preprocessing techniques.

| Step            | Effect                              |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Resample 16kHz  | Standardizes audio format           |
| Trim silence    | Removes silent parts                |
| Noise reduction | Attempts to remove background noise |

# ASR Observation

- Whisper is very stable on all audio files
- Preprocessing does not change results for clean audio
- Only noisy audio would show improvement

# Bonus — Text-to-Speech (TTS)

# Key Takeaway

> OCR benefits strongly from preprocessing, while ASR (Whisper) is already highly optimized and often does not benefit from additional preprocessing on clean audio.
